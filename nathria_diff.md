# Castle Nathria Differences between difficulty levels

## Shriekwing:
***Heroic***
*In the 'standard' phase one ability is added:* 
-  [Echoing Screech](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342863/echoing-screech) - The boss will target a **random non-tank player**. 
Shriekwing will begin by shooting a Sonar disc **at this player** and then shoot **4 more sets from her sides**, these will bounce off pillars and walls. If any player is hit with any of these they will be horrified for 2 seconds and trigger [Descent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342923/descent).

### TLDR: dodge Sonar discs in all phases of the fight.

##  Huntsman Altimor
***Heroic***
*In phase 1, one ability is added:* 
- Margore will apply [Vicious Wound](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334960/vicious-wound) to all people hit on [Vicious Lunge](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334939/vicious-lunge). Because of this you will not want to soak Vicious Wound with the entire raid, but a smaller group of players.

*In phase 2, one ability is added:
- The soul spawned by Bargast's [Rip Soul](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334797/rip-soul) will now pulse damage to the raid every 2 seconds via [Unstable Soul](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=339639/unstable-soul).

### TLDR: soak Margore's Vicious Lunge with a smaller number of players, heal Bargast's souls faster (+raidwide healing cooldown probably needed).

##  Hungering Destroyer
***Heroic***
*one ability is added:* 
- [Obliterating Rift](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=332375/obliterating-rift) - Whenever an [) Expunge](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=329742/expunge) debuff expires an [Obliterating Rift](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=332375/obliterating-rift) orb will now spawn at that location. These orbs are permanent and can be removed from the encounter space by running into them, however this will deal a large amount of Shadow damage. Players with immunities can soak these, however they can also be ignored as long as there is space to run away from the boss for [Consume](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334522/consume).

### TLDR: after 'big blue circles, everyone spread out', blue orbs will spawn at everyone's location. Don't run into these unless you have an immunity. (possibly have raid move farther away from boss before spreading)

##  Sun King's Salvation
***Heroic***
*one ability added, one change in targeting:* 
- Pestering Fiend now has [Fagmentation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=336398/fragmentation)When they die they will explode dealing a moderate amount of Physical damage to all players within 7 yards. As these mobs spawn in large waves you will need to be careful to not kill too many at once.
- Shade of Kaelthas now targets [Blazing Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329518/blazing-surge) at a random player instead of the tank.
### TLDR: Pestering Fiend adds now explode on death, don't kill all at once.
