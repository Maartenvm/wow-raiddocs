# Castle Nathria Differences between difficulty levels

## Shriekwing:
***Heroic***
*In the 'standard' phase one ability is added:* 
-  [Echoing Screech](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342863/echoing-screech) - The boss will target a **random non-tank player**. 
Shriekwing will begin by shooting a Sonar disc **at this player** and then shoot **4 more sets from her sides**, these will bounce off pillars and walls. If any player is hit with any of these they will be horrified for 2 seconds and trigger [Descent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342923/descent).

### TLDR: dodge Sonar discs in all phases of the fight.

##  Huntsman Altimor
***Heroic***
*In phase 1, one ability is added:* 
- Margore will apply [Vicious Wound](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334960/vicious-wound) to all people hit on [Vicious Lunge](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334939/vicious-lunge). Because of this you will not want to soak Vicious Wound with the entire raid, but a smaller group of players.

*In phase 2, one ability is added:
- The soul spawned by Bargast's [Rip Soul](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334797/rip-soul) will now pulse damage to the raid every 2 seconds via [Unstable Soul](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=339639/unstable-soul).

### TLDR: soak Margore's Vicious Lunge with a smaller number of players, kill Bargast's souls faster.

##  Hungering Destroyer
***Heroic***
*one ability is added:* 
- [Obliterating Rift](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=332375/obliterating-rift) - Whenever an [) Expunge](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=329742/expunge) debuff expires an [Obliterating Rift](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=332375/obliterating-rift) orb will now spawn at that location. These orbs are permanent and can be removed from the encounter space by running into them, however this will deal a large amount of Shadow damage. Players with immunities can soak these, however they can also be ignored as long as there is space to run away from the boss for [Consume](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=334522/consume).

### TLDR: after 'big blue circles, everyone spread out', blue orbs will spawn at everyone's location. Don't run into these unless you have an immunity.
